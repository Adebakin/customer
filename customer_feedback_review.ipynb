This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided.\\n\\n\\nAircraftA320\\nType Of TravellerBusiness\\nSeat TypeBusiness Class\\nRouteLondon Heathrow to Munich\\nDate FlownSeptember 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2/10\\n\\n\\n\"won the race to the bottom\" \\n\\n\\nJohn Rockett (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2023\\n\\nNot Verified |  Awful.

You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to the gate. The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don\\'t have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress. In the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meeting. I thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it\\'s routine for BA not to fly on time.\\n\\n\\nAircraftA320\\nType Of TravellerBusiness\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteLondon to Geneva\\nDate FlownOctober 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"It is a national disgrace\"\\n\\n\\nA Dawson (United Kingdom) 30th September 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I\\'m not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curry. Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn\\'t check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being \\'bumped\\' to economy.

The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost. I filled the form and gave to the employee. I was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference number. BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address. I had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty website. They delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt. I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC. Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BA.

The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues. The time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will not ever use them again.\\n\\n\\nAircraftA321\\nType Of TravellerBusiness\\nSeat TypeBusiness Class\\nRouteLondon to Seville\\nDate FlownSeptember 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"Never again will I fly BA\"\\n\\n\\n1 reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nC Horden (United Kingdom) 27th September 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled our flight last-minute then moved us onto a flight 2 days later operated by Japan Airlines. We had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as I am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane. Because it was operated by a different airline but booked by BA, neither BA nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being available. After 4 hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport. I did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online. I got a £10 meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a 14 hour flight. Never again will I fly BA. I would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteLondon Heathrow to Tokyo\\nDate FlownSeptember 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"never fly this awful airline again\" \\n\\n\\nP Cooper (United States) 23rd September 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified | I had a flight from Miami, Florida to Dublin, Ireland, via London\\'s Heathrow airport. The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin. When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London\\'s City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight. The person who rebooked us, told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure. I will never fly this awful airline again. Given the other feedback on this site, it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeBusiness Class\\nRouteMiami to Dublin via London Heathrow\\nDate FlownAugust 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"I’ll never fly with them again\"\\n\\n\\nBruce Friedman (United States) 22nd September 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  We started our day with BA in Prague. The flight actually left on time! I came to find out that’s very unusual. We purchased business class seats. As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class. All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class. Horrible flight. In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn’t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy. I almost got a hernia having to close it. This is a horrible airline. I’ll never fly with them again.

The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate. I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst. It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff. My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerBusiness\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteLondon to Glasgow\\nDate FlownSeptember 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"everyone refused to help us\" \\n\\n\\nTerri Galli (France) 20th September 2023\\n\\nNot Verified |  Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take off, we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problem. After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn\\'t rebook on the application because the app wouldn\\'t disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it\\'s 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don\\'t have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven\\'t heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I\\'ll be reimbursed, even though I\\'m not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It\\'s financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it\\'s impossible to reach them by phone. I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerFamily Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteSan Diego to Marseille via London \\nDate FlownAugust 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"not a single feedback from British Airways\"\\n\\n\\nSelcuk Benter (Germany) 20th September 2023\\n\\nNot Verified |  My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight.

Me and several other passengers spent the night in London.

I was supposed to fly out to Italy on 7 September 2023. I arrived at OR Tambo International airport ready to check my bags in (I already checked-in online the previous evening so I had my boarding pass ready). At the counter I was told that I had been off-loaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled. No information was sent regarding this beforehand. The team at the check-in counter tried to get me on another flight that evening, but there were no flights available. They did manage to get me another flight the following evening with Lufthansa to Italy via Frankfurt. However, I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than I was supposed to. Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order, which they assured me is correct. I have to fly back to South Africa on 18 September and upon checking my booking information I noticed on my BA account that my first flight (Milan to London) is just missing from my booking. My connecting from London to Johannesburg is still there. After spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances, the moment I proceed to give my booking reference number, my call gets dropped.

No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to call British Airways. We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though these were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still I have not heard from British Airways. This is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades. I am a very patient person and this is the first time I have commented on this type of forum.

I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteFrankfurt to London City\\nDate FlownSeptember 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\"less than a premium experience\"\\n\\n\\n73 reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nRajan Parrikar (Iceland) 4th September 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights. The seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on British Airways the Business Class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft.

This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I\\'ve seen on airplanes. BA\\'s new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn\\'t an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn\\'t at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time.

How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no.

I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier.

I arrived at JFK ready for my flight to Malaga, only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice. After a draining 2-hour altercation, I was finally placed on a different flight. The nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son\\'s wedding. Thirty agonizing hours later, the bags showed up—but my brand-new iPad and a special watch for my nephew were missing. The items weren\\'t merely valuable; they had emotional significance, which made the loss even more gut-wrenching. You\\'d think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors.  Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit. Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. Their response was, in essence, \"It\\'s your fault for trusting us with your belongings.\" This isn\\'t just poor customer service; it\\'s a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility. British Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to. If you have any respect for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid British Airways at all costs. They not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err, leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteNew York JFK to Malaga via London\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"express our displeasure and concerns\"\\n\\n\\nRobert Brown (United States) 31st August 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  This is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to Italy. Our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us, coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us (9 and 12 days)! Our departure dates: June 19, 2023 - Flight BA 294, Chicago to London. June 20 rebooked by BA on BA 546, London to Rome. All flights were late. On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife\\'s. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife\\'s bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4” easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago. On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries, also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago. After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA. We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA’s errors. I can honestly say that the times I was able to reach a human being, they were all courteous and attempted to help, but appeared at a loss. \\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypePremium Economy\\nRouteChicago to Rome via London\\nDate FlownJuly 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"they are the worst in Europe\"\\n\\n\\nRich Glasier (United Kingdom) 30th August 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe.

After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient.

First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteFrankfurt to London Heathrow\\nDate FlownAugust 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"appalling customer service\"\\n\\n\\nC Hill (United Kingdom) 28th August 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  Filthy plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint.

Sadly, BA airport standards at T5 are worse than ever, and we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuse. As a short haul club Europe trip, I expect very little from BA any more, and they barely even provide that, with cutbacks during Covid that are now permanent. If you can find an alternative carrier on the same route, choose them rather than BA.

We were then put on the same flight one day later with no other choice offered. As we were already at the airport, we proceeded to check in to ask what caused the cancellation (apparently the pilot was sick and there was nobody available on standby) and what we could do about it. The Business Class check-in desk assistant, was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our bags for the following day. We found someone else who told us we could check them in 24 hrs prior to departure, so we waited at the airport an further 2 hours and checked them in, after which we went back home. We were not offered a refund, nor told how to claim for the extra expenses incurred (train, change fees for the connecting flight to Zimbabwe, loss of one night stay at a very expensive safari lodge etc), we were not offered anything.

There were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and worked. Seat was also long enough to really lay out and get some sleep. The video system worked great and had plenty of content. The headphones however were cheap and didn\\'t feel or work particular good. The layout on this 773 had a lot of business class seats, a lot! We sat in the forward cabin (enter aircraft turn left) and that cabin is the quieter part of the aircraft. The crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have had. One draw back to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider didn\\'t open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling together.

My bread roll, white olive bread, was dry. I wonder whether anyone in BA monitors that. Club class has become Economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in Club class.

Onboard I sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff. In flight entertainment system didn’t work very well, the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use, it could use updating. The food for dinner was decent, they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards. The seat was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smooth. After we missed our connection and we’re stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts, they rebooked us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the next day, gave us free bus tickets to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room, and gave us Dinner and Breakfast vouchers.

I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin\\'s place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn\\'t find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That\\'s when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase \"abandoned\" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don\\'t explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn\\'t travel by train to my cousin\\'s place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn\\'t want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn\\'t budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren\\'t the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I\\'ve been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn\\'t care. They said there was nothing they could do. I\\'m sure if one of the BA executive\\'s friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteGibraltar to London Heathrow\\nDate FlownMay 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"lives in their past glory\"\\n\\n\\nAlwaleed Althani (Qatar) 26th July 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified | An airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is British Airways.

What a disaster! First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane). No money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given. I also had pre-purchased food and they couldn’t provide the service. All in all, terrible.

My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA\\'s staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA\\'s \\'Commercial Change Booking Team\\' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had \\'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight\\'. They\\'ve continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteLondon City Airport to Frankfurt\\nDate FlownJuly 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4/10\\n\\n\\n\"pilot apologise at every step of the way\"\\n\\n\\nD Keane (United Kingdom) 21st July 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way.

The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience. \\n\\n\\nAircraftBoeing 787\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteSeattle to London Heathrow\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2/10\\n\\n\\n\"made their economy experience so miserable\"\\n\\n\\nAlan Lacey (United Kingdom) 20th July 2023\\n\\nNot Verified |  I\\'m sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class.

Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the \"free water\" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle..

BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn\\'t care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren\\'t bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA\\'s way, I\\'d suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers.

I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them.\\n\\n\\nAircraftBoeing 777\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypePremium Economy\\nRouteChennai to London \\nDate FlownJuly 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2/10\\n\\n\\n\"I will never fly this airline again\"\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Rice (United States) 9th July 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It\\'s very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn\\'t leave the boarding area.

Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70\\'s and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom.

Flight was delayed with no communication given. Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. Seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible. There is next to no recline. However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft. No amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly.

We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteDubai to Keflavik via London\\nDate FlownMay 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendednoClose \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2/10\\n\\n\\n\"preferred to fly on easyJet\"\\n\\n\\n1 reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nRalph Tuckwell (United Kingdom) 29th June 2023\\n\\nNot Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I\\'m used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don\\'t get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don\\'t want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a \\'premium economy\\' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it\\'s a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA. \\n\\n\\nAircraftA321Neo\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteCairo to London\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"stated it is not their fault\"\\n\\n\\nN Beale (United Kingdom) 27th June 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after me.

Its sitting in Terminal 3 in LHR (I have an air tag on my luggage) and British Airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it.

They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to the US. Now, I’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me. They appease me on the phone, tell me they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up.

Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypeBusiness Class\\nRouteLondon to Amman\\nDate FlownMarch 2023\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2/10\\n\\n\\n\"no boarding drinks provided\"\\n\\n\\nE Lanewoski (United Kingdom) 25th June 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying with BA business class, never again.

Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don\\'t fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of \"supply issues\". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn\\'t eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy.\\n\\n\\nAircraftEmbraer 190\\nType Of TravellerFamily Leisure\\nSeat TypeBusiness Class\\nRouteLondon City to Ibiza\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedyes \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"Communication is terrible\"\\n\\n\\nM King (United States) 23rd June 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely horrible airline.

World Traveller (aka Economy) Class. Both flights departed on time.

Flights OK - FA\\'s (particularly on return flight) pleasant enough. But, as usual, Economy class seating was truly dreadful - no legroom at all.

We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available.

They won\\'t treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right.

The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerSolo Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteDublin to London City\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"uncomfy old planes\"\\n\\n\\nMichael Hayward (United Kingdom) 11th June 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. I have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights. The customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as I no longer intend to use BA for any further flights. Terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff. \\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerBusiness\\nSeat TypeBusiness Class\\nRouteTokyo to Manchester via Heathrow\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nWifi & Connectivity\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"never fly British Airway ever again\"\\n\\n\\nGeorge W Edmonds  (United States) 11th June 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  The customer service is ugly.

It\\'s a long time since I have flown long-haul, the cramped conditions were awful. The rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my TV was so close I couldn\\'t focus on it.  BA seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade, this has not worked on me, I will avoid flying BA in future. My onward flight was with LATAM, same 787 aircraft but more room between rows, far more comfortable. On the return flight from Santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm, I feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service, they just disappear behind the curtains.\\n\\n\\nAircraftBoeing 787\\nType Of TravellerFamily Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteSantiago to London\\nDate FlownMay 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\"I will never fly British Airways again\"\\n\\n\\nK Pickering (United States) 8th June 2023\\n\\n✅ Trip Verified |  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don\\'t want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either.\\n\\n\\nType Of TravellerCouple Leisure\\nSeat TypeEconomy Class\\nRouteSeattle to Nice via London\\nDate FlownJune 2023\\n\\nSeat Comfort\\n12345\\n\\n\\nCabin Staff Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nFood & Beverages\\n12345\\n\\n\\nInflight Entertainment\\n12345\\n\\n\\nGround Service\\n12345\\n\\n\\nValue For Money\\n12345\\n\\nRecommendedno \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<<\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\n>>\\n\\n\\n1 to 100 of 3666 Reviews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBritish Airways Photos\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                \\tView all photos\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBritish Airways is the flag carrier of the United Kingdom, with its main hub being at London Heathrow Airport where it operates from Terminal 5 and Terminal 3. The airline also has substantial operations from Gatwick Airport. British Airways is a member of Onweworld alliance, and part of International Airlines Group (IAG).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFIRST CLASS\\n\\n\\nBritish Airways offers First Class on many long haul routes operated by widebody aircraft (Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777, Boeing 787 and the A380). Most aircraft have 14 flat-bed seats in First Class, and 8 seats on the Boeing 787-9.  \\n\\nFlat bed seat / suite\\nIn-seat &/or USB power\\nOnboard WiFi\\nAudio / video on demand\\nOn demand dining\\nFine wines & beverage service\\nPillows & duvet / blanket\\nPyjamas / Sleepsuit\\nAmenity kit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBUSINESS CLASS\\n\\n\\nBranded as Club World for long haul and Club Europe for short haul services, British Airways was one of the pioneers of flat bed seats in long haul business class. The product is overdue an upgrade, with the seat layout on a Boeing 777 being 8-across in contrast to the more standard 4-across layout. British Airways Club Europe cabin uses a standard Economy class seat, with the middle of each 3-across section left empty. British Airways charges business class customers to reserve seats for both long haul and short haul flights..\\n\\nLONG HAUL\\nFlat bed seat\\nIn-seat &/or USB power\\nOnboard WiFi\\nAudio / video on demand\\nOn demand dining\\nPillows & duvet / blanket\\nPyjamas / Sleepsuit\\nAmenity kit\\n\\nSHORT HAUL\\nSeat pitch : 31 ins\\nSeat width : 17 ins\\nIn-seat &/or USB power\\nOnboard WiFi\\nInflight entertainment\\nComplimentary meal / snack\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREMIUM ECONOMY\\n\\n\\nBritish Airways offers a premium economy cabin on their long haul / widebody aircraft, branded as World Traveller Plus.
